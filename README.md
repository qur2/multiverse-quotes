# multiverse-quotes

Just drop any elephant you would be busy with and let the great A'Tuin take you
to various times/places in the Multiverse.
Cycle through the quotes taken from various Terry Pratchett books. If you read
those books, hopefully the quotes will bring back a smile on your face.
If you're new to Pratchett's Multiverse, curiosity should turn you into an
aspirant Chelonii specialist.


## Genesis
I'm a computer scientist and I'm trying to teach myself new tech stuff on a
regular basis. One of the difficulty in doing so is finding what to build with
that new technology.
This time, I wanted to try out the Facebook library called React.
Since I read almost all the books of Pratchett (he's by far my favorite
author), I decided I'd build something about that.


## Where are the quotes coming from?
I told you, Pratchett is my favorite author. While I've been reading the books,
I liked some description, conversation, ... so much that I've been bookmarking
them.
For this tiny project, I decided to use them, hoping at the same time I'd
broadcast some enthousiasm about Terry's amazing work.

In others words, it's a gallery of quotes curated personally by me :)


## I cannot read French
Well, I'm sorry. At the moment, I've been reading the books only in French.
Most (all ?) of the translations are done by Patrick Couton. While I cannot
compare to the English books, I do think he's been doing an awesome job. And
if you decide to learn French because of that, you will not be disappointed :)


## Credits
Of course all the credits go to Terry Pratchett and Patrick Couton. I'm not
affiliated or related in any way to them, although I would not mind at all.
